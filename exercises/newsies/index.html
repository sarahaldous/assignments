    <h3>Students Survive Week 1 at V School</h3>
    <p>Despite snow, students arrived (and kept arriving) on campus three days this week, staying awake using caffeine and the sheer force of will. <b>Some</b> of them even learned things they didn't already know. </p>
    <p>Many students were delighted by the way the building shakes, making them feel like they actually were in Silicon <i>Valley</i>, not Silicon <i>Slopes</i>.</p>
    <p><span>Also much appreciated was the lovely view out the south window, which showcases a Carl's Jr. with a drive-through. A random poll of several students suggested that this alone was worth the tuition money they paid to come here for the next twelve weeks.</span></p>
