Good project!  I love that its 90% responsive and looks like a video game.  

Styling on the answer output needs work.  It took me a while to find where the result was getting output on the page.

Your CSS class names are good and descriptive for the most part.  Lets bring those good naming conventions into your JS and avoid using name like 'g', 'b', or 'c' for variables.

Good indentations and spacing in your code.  It was easy to read and formatted properly.

Keep up the good work.
